# Real-time-Smart-Surveillance
Incidents of violence and weapon-related threats in public and institutional settings have underscored the limitations of traditional CCTV systems, which rely heavily on human monitoring. This project proposes an AI-powered surveillance system designed to automatically detect violent behavior and weapons in real-time video streams, aiming to enhance situational awareness and enable faster responses. The system integrates edge computing, cloud services, and deep learning models in a modular full-stack architecture. For violence detection, a motion-aware MobileNetV2 model was deployed on a Raspberry Pi, combining spatial features with optical flow to identify aggressive actions. This model achieved a testing accuracy of 77.2% and an F1-score of 78.4%. For weapon detection, an ensemble approach employing late fusion was used, combining YOLOv8s for object-level detection with a MobileNetV2-based frame-level classifier. The backend, built using Node.js and Express, manages user authentication, real-time alert delivery via WebSockets, and interaction with a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS. Videos and images are stored on AWS S3, and accessed through direct URLs stored in the database. The Flutter-based frontend provides role-specific dashboards for administrators and security personnel, allowing users to view alerts, stream incident videos, and manage system configurations. By combining lightweight AI models with scalable cloud infrastructure and a responsive frontend, the system offers a practical, low-latency solution for intelligent surveillance. It demonstrates strong performance in both accuracy and real-time responsiveness, making it suitable for deployment in schools, offices, and other high-security environments.
